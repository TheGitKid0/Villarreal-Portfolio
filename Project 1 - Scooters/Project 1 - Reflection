Overall, I believe this is my best project on my portfolio. I worked very well with my partner as I was the one who suggested which specific nodes we should use. To make it even better, I would like to either expand the scope of the project to include more nodes and have it be more accurate representation of the theoretical scenario. There was a bug that was not fixed where scooters would clump up unaturally so if I ever did this again, I would want to fix it.
