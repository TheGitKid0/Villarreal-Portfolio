This assignment was particularly difficult for me as I did not grasp the Python concepts that it recquired me to know. As such, I did not make much progress in the hour I was given to do it.

Overall, this assignment has room to improve massively. If I do it again, I will have to have a better grasp of the concepts that it asks me to employ.
