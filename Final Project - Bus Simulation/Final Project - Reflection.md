This project was actually easier than I thought it would be. I repurposed the scooter code to simulate a bus route by making adjacent nodes connect in an open loop with the first and last node not being connected due to the two locations being very far apart in my simulation.

The presentation I did was also fairly easy once I sat down to do it and I provided visual snippets of the code so the presentation has context.

Overall, I believe I did fairly well with the the lack of time I afforded myself, The code itself can very much still be improved but as of right now, I feel satisfied to how it turned out.
