Overall, I believe this is also another very strong project. My partner and I very much discussed how we would solve the problem particularly with me suggesting we take a slightly different approach than we did for the "alternative realities" section. From all the projects I worked on that had partners, I believe this was my best showing of teamwork particularly since I knew my partner for some time before we started CSC 235.
