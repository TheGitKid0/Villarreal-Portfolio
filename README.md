This is my portfolio for CSC 235. In here, all 4 major projects will be found.

The projects are as follows:
Project 1: a simulation of scooters being used in the Union College campus with the co creator being Theophilus Henle
Project 2: a simulation of a sudden event where the world's population snapped in half woth the coauthor being Miraj Parekh
Project 3: implementations of 2D convolution
Project 4: flocking simulation using pygame

In the projects where I had a partner, I served as the navigator as I suggested ideas for the driver to implement in the project.
