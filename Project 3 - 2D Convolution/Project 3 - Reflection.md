This convolution project was very much difficult for me. Even after scouring many sources, I still barely understand how to even make a convolution function. This is what I was able to do.

Overall, this is one of my weaker showings. What I learned here is that I should very much ask for help as soon as my lack of understanding actively prevents me from completing an assingment.
