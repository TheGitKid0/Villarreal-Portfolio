This was the first assignment of the class. However, I found myself struggling to solve the physics based problems in the assigment and I could not seem to figure out some concepts in python that I had never seen prior to this.

Overall, I don't think I did terribly but there is definitely room for improvemnt if I were to do this all over again.
